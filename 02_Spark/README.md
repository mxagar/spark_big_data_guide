# Spark

I made these notes while following the Udacity course [Spark](https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-spark-at-udacity--ud2002).

Additionally, I extended the  notes with contents from the following courses at the Datacamp track [Big Data with PySpark](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/big-data-with-pyspark):

- Introduction to PySpark
- Big Data Fundamentals with PySpark
- Cleaning Data with PySpark
- Feature Engineering with PySpark
- Machine Learning with PySpark
- Building Recommendation Engines with PySpark

## 1. Introduction

This module is an introductory module of Udacity, where the basic course structure is explained, as well as a project.

### Udacity Project Overview

Video: [Project Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPCzCEG2yRs)

I made a dedicated repository for the Udacity final project: [sparkify_customer_churn](https://github.com/mxagar/sparkify_customer_churn). I have non-committed link to that repository in the folder [`lab`](./lab/); additionally, all coding examples from this module are collected in that folder [`lab`](./lab/).

Key ideas of the project:

- Music streaming service, similar to Spotify: Users can listen to streamed music.
- We have: (1) free-tier, (2) subscription plan.
- Every time an user is involved in an event, it is logged with a timestamp; example events: songplay, logout, like, ad_heard, downgrade, etc.
- Goal: predict churn, either (1) as downgrade from premium to free or (2) as leaving the service.
- With churn predictions, the company can target those users with incentives: discounts, etc.
