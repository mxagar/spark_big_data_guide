I made these notes while following the Udacity course [Spark](https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-spark-at-udacity--ud2002).

Additionally, I extended the  notes with contents from the following courses at the Datacamp track [Big Data with PySpark](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/big-data-with-pyspark):

- Introduction to PySpark
- Big Data Fundamentals with PySpark
- Cleaning Data with PySpark
- Feature Engineering with PySpark
- Machine Learning with PySpark
- Building Recommendation Engines with PySpark
