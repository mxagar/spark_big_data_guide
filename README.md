# Spark and Big Data Guide

This repository contains my personal guide on Spark and topics related to Big Data. The contents originate from projects, tutorials and courses, such as:

- [Udacity: Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-hadoop-and-mapreduce--ud617)
- [Udacity: Deploying a Hadoop Cluster](https://www.udacity.com/course/deploying-a-hadoop-cluster--ud1000)
- [Udacity: Spark](https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-spark-at-udacity--ud2002)
- [Datacamp: Big Data with PySpark Track](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/big-data-with-pyspark)

The repository is structured in folders, which contain a Markdown file with the associated topic guide and the related code/exercises:

- [`00_Intro_Big_Data`](./00_Intro_Big_Data)
- [`01_Intro_Hadoop`](./01_Intro_Hadoop)
- [`02_Intro_Spark`](./02_Intro_Spark)
- [`03_More_Spark`](./03_More_Spark)

To use this guide, open the desired topic folder and read the main Markdown in there; if you're new to the topic, follow a sequential order.
