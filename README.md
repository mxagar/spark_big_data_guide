# Spark and Big Data Guide

This repository contains my personal guide on Spark and topics related to Big Data. The contents originate from projects, tutorials and courses, such as:

- [Udacity: Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-hadoop-and-mapreduce--ud617)
- [Udacity: Deploying a Hadoop Cluster](https://www.udacity.com/course/deploying-a-hadoop-cluster--ud1000)
- [Udacity: Spark](https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-spark-at-udacity--ud2002)
- [Datacamp: Big Data with PySpark Track](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/big-data-with-pyspark)

The repository is structured in folders/modules, which contain a Markdown file with the associated topic guide and the related code/exercises:

- [`00_Intro_Big_Data`](./00_Intro_Big_Data): general introduction material, without code.
- [`01_Intro_Hadoop`](./01_Intro_Hadoop): introduction material on Hadoop; small code examples are shown, but not implemented.
- **[`02_Spark`](./02_Spark): full Spark course with exercises.**
<!--
- [`03_More_Spark`](./03_More_Spark): additional topics.
-->

To use this guide, open the desired topic folder and read the main Markdown in there; if you're new to the topic, follow a sequential order. To run the exercises and examples, you'll need to set up an environment either locally or remotely; all instructions for that should be provided in each folder/module.
